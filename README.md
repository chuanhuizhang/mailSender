In this project, I use a package form phpMailer which is better than the main() function of php.
This package contains a phpMailer class. The class contains the attributes and functions of sending Email.
So all I should do is to create an object of this class and configure the attributes of this object.
What's more, this class also need to configure the smtp to assign a server to send the email.
So I put the class.smtp.php file here. And PHPMailerAutoload.php is just called by the phpMailer class constructor.

In order to make sure the email address is a validate one, I use JavaScript to check the address input.
